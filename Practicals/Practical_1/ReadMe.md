# Practical 1 – Python Basics, Control Structures, Data Structures, File Operations & Operators

## 1. Instructions
This practical required us to complete several tasks demonstrating fundamental Python concepts.  
The instructions included:
1. Using basic data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
2. Implementing control structures (conditionals, loops, break, continue)
3. Working with common data structures (lists and dictionaries)
4. Performing file operations on text and binary files
5. Applying arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators

## 2. Solutions Summary
Below is a summary of the work completed for each section:

### a. Basic Concepts**
- Used integers, floats, strings, and boolean data types.
- Performed basic operations to confirm correct usage.

### b. Control Structures**
- Implemented `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- Used `for` and `while` loops for repetition.
- Demonstrated the use of `break` and `continue` inside loops.

### c. Data Structures**
- Created and modified **lists** (adding, removing, accessing elements).  
- Created and used **dictionaries** (keys, values, updating entries).

### d. File Operations**
- Created, opened, read, and wrote **text files**.
- Worked with **binary files**.
- Practiced file management tasks such as renaming and deleting files.

### e. Operators**
- Applied arithmetic operations to calculate values.
- Used assignment operators to update variables.
- Used comparison and logical operators in conditions and expressions.

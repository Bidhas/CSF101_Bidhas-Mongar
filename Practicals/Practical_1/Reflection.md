# Reflection – Practical 1  
Python Basics, Control Structures, Data Structures, File Operations & Operators

## 1. Documentation
In this practical, I worked with different foundational components of Python and applied them through small tasks and examples. The areas covered included:

### **a. Basic Concepts**
I used Python’s basic data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans. These helped me understand how Python stores and processes simple values.

### **b. Control Structures**
I applied conditional statements (if, elif, else) and loops (for and while). I also used break and continue to manage loop flow. These tasks helped me understand decision-making and repetition in programs.

### **c. Data Structures**
I worked with lists and dictionaries to store, access, and update data. Lists helped with ordered collections, while dictionaries stored key–value pairs.

### **d. File Operations**
I performed reading and writing operations on text files, handled binary files, and practiced file management tasks such as renaming and deleting files.

### **e. Operators**
I used arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators to perform calculations and evaluate conditions.

## 2. Reflection
From this practical, I gained a better understanding of how Python works at a fundamental level. I learned how different data types behave, how control structures affect the flow of a program, and how data structures store information. Working with files taught me how programs interact with external data, which is important for real-world applications.

Overall, this practical strengthened my foundational programming skills and made me more confident in writing and testing simple Python programs.

## 3. Challenges Faced
### **1. File Handling**
At first, I made mistakes with file modes and paths. Sometimes files didn’t open or save correctly. I solved this by using the correct modes (`"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`, `"rb"`, `"wb"`) and double-checking file locations.

### **2. Loop Flow Errors**
Using break and continue incorrectly caused some loops to skip values or end too early. I fixed this by adjusting the order of statements and testing small segments at a time.

### **3. Dictionary Access Errors**
I encountered key errors when accessing dictionary elements that didn’t exist. Using the `.get()` method helped avoid these issues.
